Many reputed governments and private colleges in India aim towards providing a class education to their students. It becomes highly important for the interested student to evaluate the choices available, according to his/her capabilities. 
This work proposes the system for analysing sentiment of tweets regarding colleges and rank the colleges accordingly. We propose a combination of Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory(CNN-LSTM) based architecture and perform sentiment analysis to continue the research in this domain and achieve better results.
